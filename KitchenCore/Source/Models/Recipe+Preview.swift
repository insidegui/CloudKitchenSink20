        In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to package instructions; reserve 1/2 cup water and drain well.

        In a small bowl, whisk together eggs and Parmesan; set aside.

        Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add bacon and cook until brown and crispy, about 6-8 minutes; reserve excess fat.

        Stir in garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low.

        Working quickly, stir in pasta and egg mixture, and gently toss to combine; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add reserved pasta water, one tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is reached.

        Serve immediately, garnished with parsley, if desired.
